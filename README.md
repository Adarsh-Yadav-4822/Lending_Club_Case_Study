## Conclusions
- The applicants living on Rent or having Morgages are more likely to default
- Applicants taking loan for Debt Consolidation are more likely to default
- Applicants taking loan for Miscelleneous purposes are more likely to default
- Loan to repay credit card bill is also a moderate indicator that the applicant will default
- Applicants with grades E,F and G are being charged high interest rates
- To our surprise charging higher interest rate increases the chances of repaying the loan, as it's evident that lower grade applicants being charged higher interest rates but after observing this behaviour with the count of defaulters it seems that lower interest rates may result in default
- With term 36 month has most of the charged of loans
- Issue year 2011 had 3256 charged of loans
- Applicants who have repaid that debt has loan amount less than 10000
- Applicants with more that 10 years of employment who are taking loan for debt consolidation are the most risky ones
- Applicants living on Rent or having mortgages who are looking to consolidate their debt are risky
- Applicants with more that 10 years of employment and living either on rent or have mortgages are having most risky profiles
- applicants with salary less than 35000 and higher than 75600 are risky
- applicants taking loan less than 5000 or higher than 19200 are risky
- There are more than 50% of the un-verified applicants that are defaulting on comparing with verified ones. So it's highly recommended to verify the loan applicants before approving the loan
