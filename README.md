- Applicants with more that 10 years of employment and living either on rent or have mortgages are having most risky profiles
- applicants with salary less than 35000 and higher than 75600 are risky
- applicants taking loan less than 5000 or higher than 19200 are risky
- There are more than 50% of the un-verified applicants that are defaulting on comparing with verified ones. So it's highly recommended to verify the loan applicants before approving the loan
